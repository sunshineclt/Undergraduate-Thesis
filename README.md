# Undergraduate-Thesis: Model-Based and Model-Free Algorithms in Human Sequential Deicison Making
## Abstract
Recently, there has been large advancement in researches about reinforcement learning. Researchers introduce several reinforcement learning models to explain human's learning behavior. The most classic two of the algorithms are "Model-Based" and "Model-Free". It has been proved that both of them co-exist in human brain, but till now there is no answer regarding how two learning systems assist or compete. We design a relatively complex experiment environment in this thesis. In order to figure out human's learning process, we also design two types of learning: randomized learning or block learning. Results show that despite the difficulty of new environment, human participants learn very well in all performance metrics. However, existing model could not fully explain participants' data. Therefore, we introduce "Q-learning with forget rate" model, which is a much better fit of participants' data than classic "SARSA learning without forget rate" model. Besides, we also introduce new "Model-Based Help Model-Free" model and "Model-Free Help Model-Based" model, implement a hybrid model, and analyze their relationship with the optimal "Q-learning with forget rate" model.
